        question: "Who is eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)?",
        answer: "To be eligible for SMP, you must be an employee who has worked for your employer continuously for at least 26 weeks up to the 'qualifying week' (the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth). You must also earn, on average, at least £123 a week."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance?",
        answer: "Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is paid by your employer. Maternity Allowance (MA) is paid by the government if you don't qualify for SMP, for example, if you're self-employed or haven't been with your employer long enough. MA is a standard flat rate."
    },
    {
        question: "Can my employer offer more than the statutory amount?",
        answer: "Yes. Many employers offer 'enhanced' or 'contractual' maternity pay, which can be more generous than the statutory minimum. Check your employment contract or company handbook for details. Our calculator shows the statutory minimum you are entitled to."
    },
    {
        question: "When does Statutory Maternity Pay start and end?",
        answer: "You can start your maternity leave and pay any time from 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth. The pay lasts for up to 39 weeks."

                        Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is the legal minimum your employer must pay you while you're on maternity leave, provided you meet the eligibility criteria. It's designed to provide financial support during the 39 weeks of your leave. Understanding your entitlement is a crucial first step in budgeting for your growing family.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                        The payment structure is split into two parts. For the first 6 weeks, you receive 90% of your average weekly earnings (with no upper limit). For the following 33 weeks, you receive a flat statutory rate (currently £{SMP_FLAT_RATE_WEEKLY} per week for 2024/25) or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever amount is lower.
                    </p>

                        Imagine your average weekly earnings are £600 before tax. For the first 6 weeks of your maternity leave, you would receive 90% of this, which is £540 per week. For the next 33 weeks, since 90% of your earnings (£540) is higher than the statutory flat rate (£{SMP_FLAT_RATE_WEEKLY}), you would receive the flat rate of £{SMP_FLAT_RATE_WEEKLY} per week. Our calculator totals this up to give you a full 39-week projection, helping you plan with confidence.
