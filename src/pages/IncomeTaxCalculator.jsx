        question: "What is the Personal Allowance?",
        answer: "The Personal Allowance is the amount of income you can earn each year before you have to pay any Income Tax. For the 2025/26 tax year, the standard Personal Allowance is £12,570. This allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 you earn over £100,000."
    },
    {
        question: "How do tax bands work?",
        answer: "Tax bands are the different levels of income on which you pay tax. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, once your income exceeds the Personal Allowance, you start paying the Basic Rate (20%). If your income is high enough, you'll move into the Higher Rate (40%) and then the Additional Rate (45%) bands. You only pay the higher rate on the portion of your income that falls within that specific band."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator suitable for Scotland?",
        answer: "This calculator uses the tax bands for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Scotland has its own set of income tax bands and rates which are different. For precise calculations for Scotland, please use our main Salary Calculator and select 'Scotland' in the advanced options."
    },
    {
        question: "Does this include National Insurance?",
        answer: "No, this calculator focuses exclusively on Income Tax to give you a clear understanding of that specific deduction. To see a full breakdown including National Insurance, pension, and student loan, please use our comprehensive Salary Calculator."

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              Income Tax is the UK government's primary source of revenue, levied on most forms of income including employment earnings, profits from self-employment, rental income, and some state benefits. This calculator is designed to provide a clear and focused breakdown of your potential Income Tax liability based on your annual gross income. It isolates this single, significant deduction to help you understand exactly how it's calculated using the UK's progressive tax band system. By entering your income, you can see how it is divided across the different tax bands—from the tax-free Personal Allowance to the Basic, Higher, and Additional rates.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Why Use a Dedicated Income Tax Calculator?</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              <li><b>Clarity and Focus:</b> Unlike a full salary calculator, this tool strips away other deductions like National Insurance, focusing solely on the Income Tax calculation.</li>
              <li><b>Educational Tool:</b> It's perfect for students, those new to the UK tax system, or anyone wanting to understand the mechanics of the tax bands.</li>
              <li><b>Financial Scenarios:</b> Quickly model how a change in income (like a bonus or a new job) will affect your tax liability without the noise of other deductions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Example Use Case</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              An individual earns £60,000 annually. They use this calculator to understand their tax. The tool shows that the first £12,570 is tax-free (Personal Allowance). The next portion of their income, from £12,571 to £50,270, is taxed at the Basic Rate of 20%. The remaining income, from £50,271 to £60,000, is taxed at the Higher Rate of 40%. The calculator clearly displays the tax paid within each band and provides a total tax figure, giving the user a precise understanding of where their money goes.
